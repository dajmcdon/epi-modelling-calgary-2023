## Mathematical modelling of disease / epidemics is very old 

* .tertiary[Daniel Bernoulli (1760)] - studies inoculation against smallpox

* .tertiary[John Snow (1855)] - cholera epidemic in London tied to a water pump

* .tertiary[Ronald Ross (1902)] - Nobel Prize in Medicine for work on malaria

* .tertiary[Kermack and McKendrick (1927-1933)] - basic epidemic (mathematical) model

## Forecasting is also old, but not that old

### US CDC Flu Challenge began in 2013

.center[
![:scale 60%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/images/weekly/flu-forecasting.jpg?_=29012)
]

&gt; CDC’s Influenza Division has collaborated each flu season with .tertiary[external researchers] on flu forecasting. &lt;br&gt;CDC has provided forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics while .tertiary[teams submit their forecasts], which are based on a variety of methods and data sources, each week.


---

## The Covid-19 Pandemic

* CDC pivoted their Flu Challenge to Covid-19 in June 2020

* Similar efforts in Germany and then Europe

]


* .secondary[Nothing similar for Canada]

* CDC now has Flu and Covid simultaneously

---

## Why the Forecast Hubs?

* Collect public forecasts in a standard format and visualize

* Used internally by CDC

* Turns out, most individual teams' forecasts are ... not great

* Combine submissions into an "Ensemble"

## Time series (simplification)

&gt; On day `\(t\)`, model hospitalizations at day `\(t+a\)` as a function of today's hospitalizations and those in the recent past.


.secondary[For example:]

`$$\widehat{y}_{t+a} = a_{0} y_{t} + a_{7}y_{t-7} + a_{14} y_{t-14} + b_0 x_t + b_{7} x_{t-7}$$`

.secondary[COVIDhub Baseline:]

`$$\widehat{y}_{t+a} = y_{t}$$`

* Seemingly, straightforward to do.
* Performs surprisingly well, most of the time.
* Not so good when you'd most want it to work.
* Uses essentially no information about epidemics.

## SIR-type (compartmental) models - Stochastic Version



.pull-left-wide[
Suppose each of N people in a bucket at time t:

1. .large[.primary[Susceptible(t)]] : not sick, but could get sick
1. .large[.secondary[Infected(t)]] : sick, can make others sick
1. .large[.tertiary[Removed(t)]] : either recovered or dead; not sick, can't get sick, can't make anyone sick



&lt;hr&gt;


**Assume**: During period h, each .primary[S] meets kh people.

**Assume**: Prob( .primary[S] meets .secondary[I] and becomes .secondary[I] ) = c.

.fourth-color[So]: Prob( .primary[S] `\(\rightarrow\)` .secondary[I] ) = `\(1 - (1 - c I(t)  / N )^{hk} \approx kchI(t) / N\)`

.fourth-color[So]: New .secondary[I] in time h `\(\sim Binom(S(t),\ kchI(t) / N)\)`

## SIR-type (compartmental) models - Stochastic Version

.pull-left-wide[

### Over-all equations:

`\begin{aligned}
C(t+h) &amp; =  \mathrm{Binom}\left(S(t),\ \frac{\beta}{N} h I(t)\right)\\
D(t+h) &amp; =  \mathrm{Binom}\left(I(t),\ \gamma h\right)\\
S(t+h) &amp; =  S(t) - C(t+h)\\
I(t+h) &amp; =  I(t) + C(t+h) - D(t+h)\\
R(t+h) &amp; =  R(t) + D(t+h)
\end{aligned}`

### In the deterministic limit, `\(N\rightarrow\infty,\ h\rightarrow 0\)`

`\begin{aligned}
N &amp;= S(0) + I(0) + R(0)\\
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; =  -\frac{\beta}{N} S(t)I(t)\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp; =  \frac{\beta}{N} I(t)S(t) - \gamma I(t)\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp; =  \gamma I(t)
\end{aligned}`

**"_the_ SIR model"** is often ambiguous between these

## Data issues 

- **Ideally** we'd see .large[.primary[S], .secondary[I], .tertiary[R]] at all times

- Easier to observe new infections, .large[.secondary[I(t+h) - I(t)]]

- Removals by death are easier to observe than removals by recovery,  
  so we mostly see .large[.tertiary[(R(t+h) - R(t))] &amp;times; (death rate)]

- The interval between measurements, say `\(\Delta\)`, is often `\(\gg h\)`

- Measuring .large[.secondary[I(t)]] and .large[.tertiary[R(t)]] (or their rates of change) is hard 
    + testing/reporting is sporadic and error prone
    + Need to model test error (false positives, false negatives) _and_ who gets tested
    + Need to model lag between testing and reporting
    
- Parameters (especially, `\(\beta\)`) change during the epidemic
    + Changing behavior, changing policy, environmental factors, vaccines, variants, ...

---

## Connecting to Data


- Likelihood calculations are straightforward if we can measure .large[.secondary[I(t)], .tertiary[R(t)]] at all times 0, h, 2h, &amp;hellip; T

- Or .large[.secondary[I(0)]], .large[.tertiary[R(0)]] and all the increments .large[.secondary[I(t+h) - I(t)], .tertiary[R(t+h) - R(t)]]

- Still have to optimize numerically

- Likelihood calculations already become difficult if the time between observations `\(\Delta \gg h\)`
    + Generally, `\(\Delta \approx\)` 1 day
    + In principle, this just defines another Markov process, with a longer interval `\(\Delta\)` between steps, but to get the likelihood of a `\(\Delta\)` step we have to sum over all possible paths of `\(h\)` steps adding up to it

- Other complications if we don't observe all the compartments, and/or have a lot of noise in our observations
    + We don't and we do.




---

## Connecting to Data

.pull-left[

- Often more tractable to avoid likelihood  (Conditional least squares, simulation-based inference)

- Intrinsic issue: Initially, everything just looks exponential
    + So it's hard to discriminate between distinct models
    + So even assuming an SIR model, it's easier to estimate `\(\beta - \gamma\)` than `\((\beta, \gamma)\)` or `\(\beta/\gamma\)`

- Can sometimes **calibrate** or fix the parameters based on other sources
    + E.g., `\(1/\gamma =\)` average time someone is infectious, which could be determined from clinical studies / observations

## These models fit well "in sample"

.pull-left[
* Track observed cases closely (they should)

* Can provide nuanced policy advice on some topics

* Many questions depend on modulating `\(\beta\)`
    1. What happens if we lock down?
    2. What happens if we mask?
    3. What happens if we have school online?
    4. Vaccine passport?
    
* Vaccination modeling is easier, directly removes susceptibles

* What about out-of-sample?

# So how do they do?
## Out-of-sample COVID Forecasting



---

## The forecast format



* Various targets "incident deaths", "incident cases", "hospital admissions"

* Produce point forecasts 

* Quantiles to measure uncertainty (set of 23)

* Predict 1-4 epiweeks ahead (or 1-28 days)

.pull-left[
* Calculated for each target   
(forecast date, location, horizon)

* For each Interval:
    1. Width of interval.
    1. Under prediction (AE to the top)
    1. Over prediction (AE to the bottom)

* Weighted average using probability content

* Mathematically equivalent to an average of quantile losses

* Discrete approximation of CRPS

## Thoughts without pictures

.pull-left[

* **Data is trouble**
    1. Both groups spend lots of time dealing with this
    2. Nowcasting
    3. Low SNR
    4. Very nonstationary
    
* **Forecast evaluation is not settled**
    1. WIS is equivalent to quantile loss, should use that.
    2. Not optimized to predict turning points. 
    3. How do we create ensembles?

]

.pull-right[

* **Hugely important to backtest properly**
    1. Data is constantly revised
    2. We see up to 10% "improvement" if we use finalized data
    3. Bigger deal in the US

* **Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics is open**
    1. How do "waves" propagate?
    2. How important is mixing?
    3. Effects of schooling?
    4. Seasonality?
    
* **True Counterfactual causal inference is open**

* **Massive survey dataset**

## `{epiprocess}`

&lt;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/&gt;

1. Data types

    * `epi_df` &amp;mdash; basically a `data.frame` but with important meta information
        1. `as_of` tag to denote the data vintage
        2. time type
        3. geo type
        4. additional keys (e.g., age, gender, race)
    * `epi_archive` &amp;mdash; a collection of `epi_df`s of different vintages
        * But stored so as to eliminate redundancies
        * Allows for important operations (filling, merging, snapshots,  )
        
2. Fundamental functionality &amp;mdash; the `slide()`

    * Rolling correlations
    * Moving averages
    * outlier correction
    * arbitrary functions
    
---

## Example of `slide()`




```r
x &lt;- x %&gt;%  # covid cases in 2 locations downloaded with `{epidatr}`
  group_by(geo_value) %&gt;% 
  mutate(smooth_spline = growth_rate(time_value, cases, method = "smooth_spline"),
         trend_filter = growth_rate(time_value, cases, method = "trend_filter"))
```

## Examining an `epi_archive`

&lt;img src="gfx/unnamed-chunk-8-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Easy to inspect revision behaviour
* Can use it for pseudo-prospective forecasts
* Compare to our procedure for the PNAS article &amp;mdash; store every version as a `.csv` and load them individually

# `{epipredict}`

&lt;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict&gt;

## Goals

1.  A set of basic, easy-to-use forecasters that work out of the box.
    You should be able to do a reasonably limited amount of
    customization on them. 
    -   Baseline flat-line forecaster
    -   Autoregressive forecaster
    -   Autoregressive classifier 
    
2.  A .secondary[framework] for creating custom forecasters out of modular
    components. 
    

### Users

.secondary[Basic.] Has data, calls forecaster with default arguments.

.secondary[Intermediate.] Wants to examine changes to the arguments, take advantage of built in flexibility.

.secondary[Advanced.] Wants to write their own forecasters. Maybe willing to build up from some components that we write.

---

## Basic autoregressive forecaster

* Predict `deaths` 1-week ahead on 0, 7, 14 day lags of cases and deaths. 
* Use `lm`, produce intervals with residual quantiles.


```r
library(epipredict)
jhu &lt;- case_death_rate_subset %&gt;% filter(time_value &gt; max(time_value) - 60)
canned &lt;- arx_forecaster(jhu, outcome = "death_rate", 
                         predictors = c("case_rate", "death_rate"))
canned$predictions
```

### Use random forests instead


```r
rf &lt;- arx_forecaster(
  jhu, outcome = "death_rate", predictors = c("case_rate", "death_rate"),
  trainer = parsnip::rand_forest(mode = "regression"), # use ranger
  args_list = arx_args_list(
    ahead = 14, lags = list(c(0:4, 7, 14), c(0, 7, 14)),
    levels = c(0.05, 1:9/10, 0.95),
    quantile_by_key = "geo_value"
  )
)
```


### Or boosting


```r
xgb &lt;- arx_forecaster(
  jhu, outcome = "death_rate", predictors = c("case_rate", "death_rate"),
  trainer = parsnip::boost_tree(mode = "regression", trees = 20), # use xgboost
  args_list = arx_args_list(
    ahead = 14, lags = list(c(0:4, 7, 14), c(0, 7, 14)),
    levels = c(0.05, 1:9/10, 0.95),
